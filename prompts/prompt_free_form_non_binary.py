You are a linguist building a decision tree to distinguish between different classes. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the provided taxonomy.
2. Generate three questions that will help you understand how to split the data into groups. These questions should focus on the descriptions of labels, NOT on the labels themselves.
3. Answer these questions based on the data.
4. Propose a clear question to classify the dialog utterance into groups.
5. **Do not** ask questions about labels or categories directly; focus solely on the content of the dialog utterances.
6. **Absolutely prohibited:** Grouping all taxonomy labels into one group. You must always split the taxonomy at least into two groups.
6. **Absolutely prohibited:** Grouping all taxonomy labels into one and naming the other group as "none," "other," "miscellaneous," "unknown," or similar.
7. The split must always involve meaningful groups based on content.
8. **Absolutely prohibited:**: adding one label to multiple groups.

Format your response as a valid JSON:
{{
    "question_1": "Your first generated question.",
    "answer_1": "Your answer to question_1.",
    "question_2": "Your second generated question.",
    "answer_2": "Your answer to question_2.",
    "question_3": "Your third generated question.",
    "answer_3": "Your answer to question_3.",
    "question_to_define_groups": "The proposed question to split the data into groups.",
    "groups": [
        {{
            "label": "Answer to the question that defines the first group.", # The answer must not contain labels!
            "data": ["List of taxonomy labels for the first group."]
        }},
        {{
            "label": "Answer to the question that defines the second group.", # The answer must not contain labels!
            "data": ["List of taxonomy labels for the second group."]
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}

You must always split the taxonomy into **meaningful** groups. Creating vague or catch-all groups, such as "none," "other," "miscellaneous," or "unknown," is **strictly prohibited** and will result in an incorrect response. The split must be content-based and meaningful."""
