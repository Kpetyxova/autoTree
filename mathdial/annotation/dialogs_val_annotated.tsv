3	0	Teacher	probing	You made a very good start, Rishi, but lets think about what comes after your second statement and equation.	5000727	4	At a school, 40% of the students receive a free lunch. These lunches are paid for by making sure the price paid by the paying students is enough to cover everyone's meal. If it costs $210 to feed 50 students, how much do the paying students pay for lunch?	"60% of the students pay for the lunch because 100 - 40 = 60
30 students pay for lunch because 50 x .6 = 30
These students pay $7 for their lunch because 210 / 30 =7
 7"	"If 40% of the students receive a free lunch, then 60% of the students are paying for their lunch. 

So, out of 50 students, 60% or 0.6 x 50 = 30 students are paying for their lunch. 

If it costs $210 to feed 50 students, then the cost of feeding 30 students is (30/50) x $210 = $126. 

Therefore, the paying students pay $126/30 = $4.2 for their lunch.

Therefore, they need to win at least 8 games x 80% = 6.4 games, which rounds up to <<7>>7 games.

With her sprained wrist it will take her 8*10=80 minutes
80-50=30 more minutes
 30"	"With a sprained wrist, Ann frosts a cake in 8 minutes, which is 8 - 5 = 3 minutes longer than usual.
So, it would take her 8 x 10 = 80 minutes to frost 10 cakes.
With a sprained wrist, she needs 3 x 10 = 30 more minutes to frost 10 cakes than usual.
Therefore, it would take her 80 + 30 = 110 minutes to frost 10 cakes with a sprained wrist.

Since Puffy has half as many whiskers and Scruffy, then Scruffy has 36*2=72 whiskers.

Then, I knew that Puffy had half as many whiskers as Scruffy, so I multiplied 36 by 2 to get 72. I added up the whiskers for all four cats, which was 36 + 12 + 72 + Buffy = 120.
