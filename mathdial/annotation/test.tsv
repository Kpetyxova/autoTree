17	0	Teacher	generic	Hi, could you please walk me through your solution?	5000851	5	40% of a farmer's cattle are males. The rest are females. If a female cow produces 2 gallons of milk a day, how much milk will the farmer get a day if he has 50 male cows?	"The farmer has 125 cows because 50 / .4 = 125
The farmer has 75 female cows because 125 x .6 = 75
The farmer will get 150 gallons of milk a day because 75 x 2 = 150
 150"	"If 40% of the cattle are males, then 100% - 40% = 60% are females.
Let's say the farmer has a total of 100 cows, then 40% of 100 = 40 cows are males.
So 60 cows are females.
If each female cow produces 2 gallons of milk a day, then 60 x 2 = 120 gallons of milk will be produced a day.
Since the farmer has 50 male cows, they don't produce milk, so the total milk produced a day is 120 gallons.

17	1	Student		Sure. I started by figuring out that 40% of the cattle were males, so 100% - 40% = 60% were females. Then I assumed that the farmer had a total of 100 cows, so 40% of 100 = 40 cows were males and 60 cows were females. I then multiplied the number of female cows (60) by 2 gallons of milk a day to get 120 gallons of milk produced a day. Since the farmer only has 50 male cows, they don't produce any milk, so the total milk produced a day is 120 gallons.	5000851	5	40% of a farmer's cattle are males. The rest are females.

 6"	"The formula for the area of a triangle is A = 1/2*b*h, where A is the area, b is the base, and h is the height.
We are given h = 8 and A = 24, and we need to find b.
Using the formula, we can solve for b:
A = 1/2*b*h
24 = 1/2*b*8
24 = 4b/2
24 = 2b
b = 12
Therefore, the base length of the triangle is <<12>>12 units.

190	7	Student		Grant makes double + $50, which is 700 + 50 = 750$.	5000635	4	Grant has worked as a freelance math worker for the last three months.  The first month he made 350$.  The second month he made 50$ more than double he made the first month.  The third month he quadrupled the sum of the first two months.  How much did Grant make in his first three months total?	"First Month:350$
Second Month:50+2(350)=750$
Third Month:4(350+750)=4400$
Total:350+750+4400=5500$
 5500"	"Grant made 50 x 2 = 100$ more than the first month on his second month.
So he made 100 + 350 = 450$ on his second month.
The sum he made in the first two months is 450 + 350 = 800$.
In his third month, he made 4 x 800 = 3200$.
Therefore, Grant made a total of 350 + 450 + 3200 = 4000$ in his first three months.
