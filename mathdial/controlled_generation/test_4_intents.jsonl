So if we have 120 couples, that would mean there are 240 students in total. We know that 3 students attended on their own, so if we subtract 3 from 240, we get 237. So there were 120 couples and 237 students in total at the prom.\nTeacher: We need to read the question again.\nTeacher: the question tells us how many people were at the prom.\nTeacher: lets start over from the beginning and ill help you if needed.\nStudent: Okay. So the question is asking how many couples attended the prom. We know that there were 123 students total and 3 of them attended on their own. That means that the rest of the students attended as couples. So if we subtract 3 from 123, we get 120. Therefore, there were 120 couples that attended the prom.\nTeacher: But 120 couples would be 240 people and youve told me only 123 came to the prom.\nStudent: That's right. We know that 120 couples attended the prom, but 3 of them attended on their own. So if we add the 120 couples and the 3 students that attended on their own, we get a total of 123 people at the prom.\nTeacher: If i gave you a 10 couples of sweets, how many sweets would i have in total?\nStudent: If you gave me 10 couples of sweets, you would have a total of 20 sweets. Each couple of sweets is made up of two individual sweets. So 10 couples of sweets would be 10 x 2, which is equal to 20.\nTeacher: So thinking about this and our prom question: we have 120 people at the prom.\nTeacher: how many couples is this?\nStudent: We know that 120 people attended the prom, and 3 of them attended on their own. That means that the rest of the students attended as couples. So if we divide 120 by 2, we get 60. Therefore, there were 60 couples that attended the prom.\nTeacher: Good, we have everything we need here to complete the question.\n\nIntent for the Next Tutor Utterance:  \ngeneric\n[/INST]\n ###Tutor:", "output": "now just talk me back through your full answer one more time with the new information, Heidi."}

If a female cow produces 2 gallons of milk a day, how much milk will the farmer get a day if he has 50 male cows?\n\nGold Solution:  \nThe farmer has 125 cows because 50 / .4 = 125\nThe farmer has 75 female cows because 125 x .6 = 75\nThe farmer will get 150 gallons of milk a day because 75 x 2 = 150\n 150\n\nStudent's Incorrect Solution:  \nIf 40% of the cattle are males, then 100% - 40% = 60% are females.\nLet's say the farmer has a total of 100 cows, then 40% of 100 = 40 cows are males.\nSo 60 cows are females.\nIf each female cow produces 2 gallons of milk a day, then 60 x 2 = 120 gallons of milk will be produced a day.\nSince the farmer has 50 male cows, they don't produce milk, so the total milk produced a day is 120 gallons.\n 120\n\nDialog:  \nTeacher: Hi, could you please walk me through your solution?\nStudent: Sure. I started by figuring out that 40% of the cattle were males, so 100% - 40% = 60% were females. Then I assumed that the farmer had a total of 100 cows, so 40% of 100 = 40 cows were males and 60 cows were females. I then multiplied the number of female cows (60) by 2 gallons of milk a day to get 120 gallons of milk produced a day. Since the farmer only has 50 male cows, they don't produce any milk, so the total milk produced a day is 120 gallons.\nTeacher: Claire, why did you assume that the farmer had 100 cows?\nStudent: I assumed that the farmer had 100 cows because it was the simplest number to use to calculate the total amount of milk produced a day. I knew that 40% of the cows were males, so I needed to figure out how many cows were females in order to calculate the total amount of milk produced a day.\nTeacher: but isnt some data already provided in the question regarding the number claire?\nStudent: Yes, the question stated that the farmer had 50 male cows, but it didn't specify how many cows the farmer had in total. So I assumed that the farmer had 100 cows in total which allowed me to calculate the total amount of milk produced a day.\nTeacher: okay, so lets consider this: 70 of your friends are female and you have 15 male friends.\nTeacher: then how many female friends do you have?\nStudent: If 70% of my friends are female, then 100% - 70% = 30% are male. If I have 15 male friends, then 100% - 30% = 70% are female. So I would have 70% of 15 male friends, which is 10.5 female friends.\nTeacher: if 70 of your friends are female, then 30 are male.\nTeacher: the number of male friends is already given, which is 15, so 30100X15 and X- 50, where X is the total number of friends.\nTeacher: now, if we figured total number of friends is 50 and 15 are males, then 501535 are females.\nTeacher: if 70 of your friends are female, then 30 are male.\nTeacher: the number of male friends is already given, which is 15, so 30100X15 and X- 50, where X is the total number of friends.\nTeacher: now, if we figured total number of friends is 50 and 15 are males, then 501535 are females.\nStudent: Yes, that makes sense. I understand now that I need to use the given information in the problem to calculate the total number of friends and then subtract the number of male friends from the total to get the number of female friends. So in this case, there would be 35 female friends.\nTeacher: very good.\nTeacher: keeping this concept in mind, can we get back to the number of cows then?\nStudent: Yes, we can. Since the question stated that the farmer had 50 male cows, then we can calculate the total number of cows by taking 30% of 50, which is 15. So the farmer would have a total of 65 cows (50 male cows + 15 female cows).\nTeacher: not quite right.\n\nIntent for the Next Tutor Utterance:  \nfocus\n[/INST]\n ###Tutor:", "output": "where did you get this 30 from?"}

I then multiplied the number of female cows (60) by 2 gallons of milk a day to get 120 gallons of milk produced a day. Since the farmer only has 50 male cows, they don't produce any milk, so the total milk produced a day is 120 gallons.\nTeacher: Claire, why did you assume that the farmer had 100 cows?\nStudent: I assumed that the farmer had 100 cows because it was the simplest number to use to calculate the total amount of milk produced a day. I knew that 40% of the cows were males, so I needed to figure out how many cows were females in order to calculate the total amount of milk produced a day.\nTeacher: but isnt some data already provided in the question regarding the number claire?\nStudent: Yes, the question stated that the farmer had 50 male cows, but it didn't specify how many cows the farmer had in total. So I assumed that the farmer had 100 cows in total which allowed me to calculate the total amount of milk produced a day.\nTeacher: okay, so lets consider this: 70 of your friends are female and you have 15 male friends.\nTeacher: then how many female friends do you have?\nStudent: If 70% of my friends are female, then 100% - 70% = 30% are male. If I have 15 male friends, then 100% - 30% = 70% are female. So I would have 70% of 15 male friends, which is 10.5 female friends.\nTeacher: if 70 of your friends are female, then 30 are male.\nTeacher: the number of male friends is already given, which is 15, so 30100X15 and X- 50, where X is the total number of friends.\nTeacher: now, if we figured total number of friends is 50 and 15 are males, then 501535 are females.\nTeacher: if 70 of your friends are female, then 30 are male.\nTeacher: the number of male friends is already given, which is 15, so 30100X15 and X- 50, where X is the total number of friends.\nTeacher: now, if we figured total number of friends is 50 and 15 are males, then 501535 are females.\nStudent: Yes, that makes sense. I understand now that I need to use the given information in the problem to calculate the total number of friends and then subtract the number of male friends from the total to get the number of female friends. So in this case, there would be 35 female friends.\nTeacher: very good.\nTeacher: keeping this concept in mind, can we get back to the number of cows then?\nStudent: Yes, we can. Since the question stated that the farmer had 50 male cows, then we can calculate the total number of cows by taking 30% of 50, which is 15.

Each pizza costs 12 dollars and the delivery charge is 2 extra dollars if the area is farther than 1 km from the pizzeria. Jimmy delivers 3 pizzas in the park, which is located 100 meters away from the pizzeria. Also, he delivers 2 pizzas in a building 2 km away from the pizzeria. How much money did Jimmy get paid for the pizzas?\n\nGold Solution:  \nAdding the pizzas delivered in the park and in the building, Jimmy delivered a total of 2 + 3 = 5 pizzas\nThe value of the 5 pizzas without delivery charge is 5 pizzas * $12/pizza = $60.\nThe cost of the delivery charge for two pizzas is 2 pizzas * $2/pizza = $4\nIn total, Jimmy got paid $60 + $4 = $64 for the pizzas.\n 64\n\nStudent's Incorrect Solution:  \nFor the 3 pizzas delivered in the park, Jimmy only needs to charge 36 dollars (3 x 12). The distance is less than 1 km, so he doesn't need to add any delivery charges.\n\nFor the 2 pizzas delivered in the building, Jimmy needs to charge 24 dollars (2 x 12).

How much did Grant make in his first three months total?\n\nGold Solution:  \nFirst Month:350$\nSecond Month:50+2(350)=750$\nThird Month:4(350+750)=4400$\nTotal:350+750+4400=5500$\n 5500\n\nStudent's Incorrect Solution:  \nGrant made 50 x 2 = 100$ more than the first month on his second month.\nSo he made 100 + 350 = 450$ on his second month.\nThe sum he made in the first two months is 450 + 350 = 800$.\nIn his third month, he made 4 x 800 = 3200$.\nTherefore, Grant made a total of 350 + 450 + 3200 = 4000$ in his first three months. \n 4000\n\nDialog:  \nTeacher: In the first month, Grant makes 350.\nTeacher: Lets break the payment for the second month down into two parts.\nTeacher: Firstly, Grant makes double what they make in the first month.\nTeacher: so this is:\nStudent: Grant makes double what he made in the first month, which is 350 x 2 = 700$.\nTeacher: And the second part is that they make doubel 50.\nTeacher: so this is:\nStudent: Grant makes double + $50, which is 700 + 50 = 750$.\nTeacher: Thats right.\nTeacher: So you know that grant makes 350 in the first month, 750 in teh second month, how much in the third month?\nStudent: In the third month, Grant quadrupled the sum of the first two months, which is 750 + 350 = 1100$. So, Grant made 1100 x 4 = 4400$ in the third month.\nTeacher: And the total for teh 3 months is:\nStudent: The total for the 3 months is 350 + 750 + 4400 = 5500$.\n\nIntent for the Next Tutor Utterance:  \ngeneric\n[/INST]\n ###Tutor:", "output": "Thats right."}
